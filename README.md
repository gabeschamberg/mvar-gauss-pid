# mvar-gauss-pid
Approximating deficiency-based PIDs for multivariate Gaussian systems

`generate.py` - Functionality for generating multivariate Gaussian systems (either randomly generated by a Wishart distribution or manually specified) and returning the relevant gain and covariance matrices for determining deficiencies.

`estimate.py` - Used for computing mutual informations, estimating deficiencies, and computing an approximate deficiency-based partial information decomposion.

`experiment.py` - Repeatedly sample random systems, approximate the PID, and store the results in `results.csv`. Running `python experiment.py` will perform 80,000 simulations, save the results, and then run the hard-coded test cases specified in `generate.py`.

`gen_figure.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for processing the results and generating a figure.
